# PureDBL (Pure DNS Block List)
Cleanup a DNS block list.
--------------------------
PureDBL strips comments, duplicates, IP addresses etc., and sorts alphabetically any DNS block list that is supplied to it using common Linux terminal commands. It outputs a blocklist with domains only; hence a 'pure' DNS blocklist.
